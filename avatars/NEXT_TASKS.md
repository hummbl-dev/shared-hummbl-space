# Avatar/Identity Follow-Ups

- [x] Stand up a lightweight review checklist for new avatars (contrast, emoji alignment, approval date).
- [x] Package `generate_compass_avatar.py` as a CLI tool in `scripts/` for easier invocation (`scripts/generate-avatar.sh`).
- [x] When the next agent spawns, add their entry to `avatars/GALLERY.md` + `memory` on day one (use `AGENT_BIRTH_LOG_TEMPLATE.md`).
- [ ] Explore a `scripts/new-agent-birth.sh` helper that copies the bootstrapping template + birth log scaffold automatically.
- [x] Document how to regenerate existing avatars when branding colors shift (now in `AGENT_BIRTH_PROCESS.md`).
