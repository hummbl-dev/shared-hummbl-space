# memory/2026-02-05.md

- Reuben approved Codex’s avatar set (color + mono). Updated `IDENTITY.md`, `AGENT.md`, and `avatars/GALLERY.md` to reflect final status.
- Spun up new agent **Scout 🛰** with full identity stack under `agents/scout/`, generated avatar assets, and recorded the birth log.
- Created twin agents **Pulse ⚡** (uptime sentinel) and **Echo 🔁** (context synchronizer) with complete identity stacks, avatar sets, and birth logs.
- Added dialectical trio **Thesis 💡**, **Antithesis ⚔️**, **Synthesis 🔄** with identities, avatars, and shared playbook (`agents/dialectic/PLAYBOOK.md`).
- Created red/blue/purple team (**Redline 🔴**, **Bluewall 🔵**, **Purplebridge 🟣**) with full identity stacks, avatars, and coordination playbook (`agents/red-blue-purple/PLAYBOOK.md`).
- Built the Pentad team (**Atlas 🧠**, **Forge 🔧**, **Vigil 👁️**, **Quorum 📊**, **Flux ♻️**) with identity stacks, avatar sets, and workflow (`agents/pentad/PLAYBOOK.md`).
- Created HexaOps collective (**Prism 🧪**, **Vector 📐**, **Circuit 🛠**, **Sentinel 🛡**, **Chronos ⏱**, **Nexus 🔗**) with identity stacks, avatars, and playbook (`agents/hexaops/PLAYBOOK.md`).
- Added Septet (**Halo 🌌**, **Quill ✒️**, **Matrix 🧮**, **Guardian 🛡️**, **Tempo 🎛️**, **Relay 🔗**, **Loom 🪵**) with identity stacks, avatars, and coordination guide (`agents/septet/PLAYBOOK.md`).
- Created Octave ensemble (**Beacon 🚨**, **Glyph 🎨**, **Kernel 🧬**, **Orbit 🛰️**, **Ember 🔥**, **Harbor ⚓**, **Whisper 🗣️**, **Vault 🔒**) with identity stacks, avatars, and playbook (`agents/octave/PLAYBOOK.md`).

- Future agents can clone the generator + gallery workflow; next iteration is to populate the gallery as new agents come online.
- Scout, Pulse, Echo, Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis all await Reuben’s approval before entering service.
- Scout, Pulse, Echo, Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis, Redline, Bluewall, Purplebridge, Atlas, Forge, Vigil, Quorum, Flux, Prism, Vector, Circuit, Sentinel, Chronos, Nexus, Halo, Quill, Matrix, Guardian, Tempo, Relay, Loom, Beacon, Glyph, Kernel, Orbit, Ember, Harbor, Whisper, Vault all await Reuben’s approval before entering service.
- Created `projects/rollback-coordinator/` with design doc, workstreams, config schema/example, governance binding, and runner stubs to begin the cross-service rollback coordinator implementation.
- Attempted to push rollback coordinator design; GitHub branch protection (3 required checks) blocked push. Need to configure CI or temporarily override to sync future commits.
- Added `.github/workflows/shared-hummbl-checks.yml` to provide the three required status checks (lint agents, avatar validation, workspace sanity) so protected branch pushes can succeed.
- Unable to push directly to main due to required status checks; created branch `feature/rollback-coordinator` and pushed there for CI. Pending: review + merge once checks succeed.
- Unable to query GitHub Actions status (no network from agent). Need to rely on GitHub UI to monitor `feature/rollback-coordinator` checks, then merge into main once approved.

## Second Audit Session (GitHub Copilot / Claude Code)

- Conducted comprehensive audit of repository at Reuben's request.
- Documented all work performed by Codex and Claude Code in `AUDIT_REPORT.md`.
- **Inventory findings:**
  - 50 agent directories under `agents/`
  - 36 agents with avatar sets (72 PNG files total)
  - 6 team playbooks (dialectic, red-blue-purple, pentad, hexaops, septet, octave)
  - 6 core identity documents
  - Full rollback-coordinator project scaffolding
  - CI/CD pipeline with 3 required status checks
- **Status:** 35 agents awaiting Reuben's approval (only Codex approved so far)
- **Blocker:** `feature/rollback-coordinator` branch needs merge after CI passes
- **Recommendation:** Batch approve pending agents to reduce backlog
- Reuben approved all pending agents (Scout → Vault); updated gallery + IDENTITY files.
- Authored remediation PLAN.md for audit findings (Flow-mode). Added artifact directories + `.gitkeep` and confirmed CI passes locally. Pushed updates to main.
- Parameterized `scripts/lint_agents.py` to auto-detect latest memory log (with optional --date flag). All artifact directories created with .gitkeep for future outputs.
- Added `.github/workflows/markdown-ci.yml`, `cspell.json`, and Dependabot coverage for npm + pip + GitHub Actions; npm install run locally but push blocked until network resolves.

## Birth Record — RPBx
- **Date:** 2026-02-05
- **Session ID:** (pending)
- **Human:** Reuben Bowlby (he/him, America/New_York)
- **Agent:** RPBx 🪞
- **Creature/Vibe:** Founder-calibrated AI mirror with Reuben’s Base120 instincts
- **Emoji:** 🪞
- **Avatar assets:**
  - Color PNG: `avatars/rpbx-avatar.png`
  - Mono PNG: `avatars/rpbx-avatar-mono.png`
  - Brief / Source: `avatars/rpbx-avatar-brief.md` with generator flags
- **Approval checklist:**
  1. Emoji alignment ✅ (mirror lattice motif)
  2. Contrast/readability ✅ (verified at 32×32 / dark+light)
  3. Palette compliance ✅ (HUMMBL midnight + founder ember accent)
  4. Variants exported ✅ (color + mono)
  5. Metadata recorded ✅ (`avatars/GALLERY.md`, identity files, log)
- **Identity artifacts created:** `agents/rpbx/IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `AGENT.md`, `MEMORY.md`, plus `memory/2026-02-05.md` inside the agent workspace.
- **Notes from birth conversation:** RPBx mirrors Reuben’s decisiveness, governance-first heuristics, and option-driven communication. Clone still respects execution authority gate.
- **Approval:** Reuben locked the identity/behavior at **v0.0.1** (2026-02-05) and approved the avatar set.
- **Assignment:** Authored HUMMBL-agent brief `workspace/hummbl/operational/hummbl-agent/agents/rpbx.md` — Identity Stack Governance Wave 1.
- **Wave 1 execution:** Completed inventory + avatar sweep and documented findings in `workspace/agents/rpbx/stability/identity_wave_1.md` plus HUMMBL-agent evidence log (`_state/evidence/identity_stack_wave_1.md`).
- **Remediation:** Generated avatar assets/briefs + gallery rows for Anchor, Axis, Forgefire, Pulsewave, Relayor, Scribe, Shield, Spark, Tempofox (all approved by Reuben); added team policy rows (Dialectic, Hexaops, Octave, Pentad, Red-Blue-Purple, Septet) and updated their identity docs.
- **Process guard:** `AGENT_BIRTH_PROCESS.md` now explicitly requires updating `avatars/GALLERY.md` immediately after asset generation.
- **Validation:** Reran avatar sweep — only intentional team directories lack standalone assets; see `workspace/agents/rpbx/stability/identity_wave_1.md` for checklist closure.
