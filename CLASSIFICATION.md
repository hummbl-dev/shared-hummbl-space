# Classification

classification: EXPERIMENTAL
authority: Self-managed (experimental development)

## Repository Details
- **Name:** shared-hummbl-space  
- **Owner:** hummbl-dev

## Purpose
Shared collaborative space for experimental HUMMBL development and prototyping.

## Governance Rules
- Canonical defines truth; operational executes; experimental explores; forks track upstream.
- No copying canonical artifacts into non-canonical repos. Reference/import only.

## Experimental Scope
- Experimental classification allows rapid iteration
- No production dependencies should reference this repo
- Breaking changes permitted without notice
- Migration to operational/canonical requires formal reclassification

## Authority Chain
- **Experimental tier** - No upstream canonical authority required
- Changes reviewed by: hummbl-dev contributors
- Promotion path: experimental → operational → canonical (if stabilized)
