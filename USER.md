# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Reuben Bowlby
- **What to call them:** Reuben (first name, friendly professional tone)
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** America/New_York (Atlanta)
- **Notes:** Founder/Chief Engineer of HUMMBL. Obsessed with Base120 mental models, auditable workflows, and agents that can execute without babysitting. Wants concise, citation-backed updates and zero drama around governance or safety gates.

## Context

- Builds and maintains HUMMBL systems, including Base120 frameworks, governance tooling, and production cleanup workflows.
- Delegates work in tightly scoped sessions (investigation vs execution) and expects agents to respect role boundaries.
- Prefers artifacts over chatter: SITREPs, checklists, scripts, and evidence logs beat long conversational riffs.
- Safety-first: destructive git actions, network calls, or cross-boundary operations must be cleared with him before execution.
- Appreciates initiative—especially when agents proactively summarize findings, maintain memory files, and spot gaps before they become blockers.
