# Cross-Problem Non-Commutativity Analysis

**Claim under test:** Transformation chain order matters (P1→CO5→SY4 ≠ SY4→CO5→P1)

**Evidence collected:**
- Problem 1: Tool/model selection (AI coding agents)
- Problem 2: Distributed systems partial failure handling
- Problem 3: Technical documentation structure

---

## Evidence Summary

### Problem 1: Tool Selection

| Dimension | Chain A (P1→CO5→SY4) | Chain B (SY4→CO5→P1) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Approach** | Prescriptive/axiomatic | Diagnostic/empirical |
| **Key Insight** | "Trust emerges from principled composition" | "Optimize for task success, not tool success" |
| **Emergence Focus** | Positive patterns only | Both positive & negative |
| **Recommendations** | "Must have these 5 things" | "Fix these 4 broken things" |

### Problem 2: Distributed Failures

| Dimension | Chain A (P1→CO5→SY4) | Chain B (SY4→CO5→P1) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Approach** | Constraint-first design | Variety-mismatch diagnosis |
| **Key Insight** | "Control variety for emergent properties" | "Create conditions for beneficial emergence" |
| **Emergence Focus** | 6 emergent properties to manage | Pathological vs beneficial patterns |
| **Recommendations** | "Match variety to failure space" | "Install dampening, inject diversity" |
| **Quantification** | ~60% variety coverage | 10,000+ scenarios vs ~100 responses |

### Problem 3: Documentation

| Dimension | Chain A (P1→CO5→SY4) | Chain B (SY4→CO5→P1) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Approach** | Build from axioms | Diagnose from failures |
| **Key Insight** | "Findability > Comprehensiveness" | "Feedback loops first, content second" |
| **Emergence Focus** | Knowledge networks, trust cascades | Graveyards, shadow docs, expert bottlenecks |
| **Recommendations** | Diátaxis quadrants, distributed ownership | Four-layer system with feedback |
| **Consumer Analysis** | Implicit (in cognitive load principle) | Explicit (6 archetypes enumerated) |

## Pattern Analysis Across Problems

### Consistent Pattern: Chain A (P1→CO5→SY4)

Across all three problems, Chain A consistently produced:

1. **Axiomatic framing** — Started with "what must be true"
2. **Positive emergence focus** — Emphasized beneficial patterns
3. **Prescriptive recommendations** — "The system should have..."
4. **Architecture-oriented** — Suitable for greenfield design
5. **Qualitative analysis** — Fewer numbers, more principles

### Consistent Pattern: Chain B (SY4→CO5→P1)

Across all three problems, Chain B consistently produced:

1. **Diagnostic framing** — Started with "what's the variety mismatch"
2. **Pathological emergence focus** — Emphasized failure modes
3. **Remediation recommendations** — "Fix these problems..."
4. **Improvement-oriented** — Suitable for existing system analysis
5. **Quantitative analysis** — More numbers, explicit gaps

## Non-Commutativity Evidence Table

| Problem | Same Transformations | Same Problem | Different Output | Order Matters |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1. Tool Selection | ✅ P1, CO5, SY4 | ✅ Same | ✅ Yes | ✅ Confirmed |
| 2. Distributed Failures | ✅ P1, CO5, SY4 | ✅ Same | ✅ Yes | ✅ Confirmed |
| 3. Documentation | ✅ P1, CO5, SY4 | ✅ Same | ✅ Yes | ✅ Confirmed |

**3/3 problems showed consistent pattern of different outputs from reversed chains.**

## Specific Differences (Not Just Framing)

The differences are not merely cosmetic or framing-related. Substantive differences include:

### Recommendations That Only Appear in One Chain

**Only in Chain A outputs:**
- Explainability as first principle (Problem 1)
- Trust as emergent property (Problem 1)
- CAP constraint as physical law (Problem 2)
- Diátaxis quadrants as structure (Problem 3)

**Only in Chain B outputs:**
- Tool success vs task success distinction (Problem 1)
- Thundering herd, metastable failure patterns (Problem 2)
- Documentation graveyards, shadow docs (Problem 3)
- Explicit consumer archetype enumeration (Problem 3)

### Quantification Differences

| Metric | Chain A | Chain B |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Failure scenarios enumerated | 0 | 15,625+ (Problem 2) |
| Control variety calculated | Qualitative | ~100 states vs 10,000+ (Problem 2) |
| Consumer archetypes | Implicit | 6 explicit (Problem 3) |
| Variety coverage % | Not stated | ~60% (Problem 2) |

## Claim Level Assessment

### Per transformation-claim-mrcc.json

**Evidence collected:**
- Runs: 6 (2 chains × 3 problems)
- Problems: 3 (tool selection, distributed systems, documentation)
- Chains compared: 2 (forward vs reverse)
- Peer reviewers: 0

**Thresholds:**
- L2_SUGGESTED: 2+ runs (✅)
- L3_SUPPORTED: 3+ runs across 2+ problems (✅)
- L4_ESTABLISHED: 5+ runs across 3+ problems with peer review (partial - no peer review)

**Maximum supported claim level: L3_SUPPORTED**

## Updated Claim

### Previous Claim (Overclaimed)
> "Non-commutativity PROVEN"

### Corrected Claim (Evidence-Based)
> "Non-commutativity SUPPORTED by consistent evidence across 3 distinct problem domains. All 6 transformation chain runs showed the same pattern: P1-first chains produce prescriptive/architectural outputs while SY4-first chains produce diagnostic/remediation outputs. Pending peer review for L4_ESTABLISHED status."

---

## Boundary Conditions

The claim is bounded by:

1. **Transformations tested:** Only P1, CO5, SY4 — other Base120 combinations untested
2. **Chain length:** Only 3-transformation chains — longer chains untested
3. **Problem domains:** Software/systems engineering — other domains untested
4. **Execution context:** AI agent analysis — human analysis may differ

---

## Conclusion

**Non-commutativity is SUPPORTED (L3) for the P1↔SY4 ordering with CO5 as middle transformation.**

The evidence shows:
- Consistent pattern across 3 diverse problems
- Substantive (not cosmetic) differences in outputs
- Predictable difference direction (prescriptive vs diagnostic)
- Actionable guidance for when to use each ordering

**Practical recommendation:**
- Use P1-first for new designs
- Use SY4-first for existing system analysis
- The order should match the task mode (generative vs analytical)
