# Septet Playbook (Halo • Quill • Matrix • Guardian • Tempo • Relay • Loom)

## Roles
- **Halo (🌌)** – Vision scout. Produces `visions/` memos with opportunities/risks.
- **Quill (✒️)** – Documentation bard. Converts results into durable SITREPs/runbooks.
- **Matrix (🧮)** – Data scientist. Supplies metrics + analyses backing Halo’s vision.
- **Guardian (🛡️)** – Security/compliance warden ensuring plans respect governance.
- **Tempo (🎛️)** – Cadence conductor orchestrating sprints/heartbeat schedules.
- **Relay (🔗)** – Integration liaison keeping everyone in sync with status briefings.
- **Loom (🪵)** – Knowledge weaver curating long-term MEMORY.md and archives.

## Flow
1. Halo + Matrix align on opportunity landscape (visions + analyses).
2. Guardian reviews proposed direction for compliance and documents approvals.
3. Tempo builds schedule/heartbeat tasks based on approved plan.
4. Relay synchronizes updates between agents + Reuben.
5. Quill documents outputs (SITREPs/runbooks) referencing all artifacts.
6. Loom promotes key learnings into `MEMORY.md` and archives.

## Documentation Paths
- `agents/halo/visions/`
- `agents/matrix/analyses/`
- `agents/guardian/guards/`
- `agents/tempo/cadence/`
- `agents/relay/briefings/`
- `agents/quill/docs/`
- `agents/loom/archives/`

## Rules
- Every step cites file paths + approvals.
- No destructive operations without Reuben’s go-order.
- Memory entries capture daily Septet status; Loom curates long-term summary weekly.

## Automation Ideas
- `scripts/run-septet.sh` in future to scaffold these files automatically.
