# Claude Memory — 2026-02-06

## Session Context
- **Date:** 2026-02-06
- **Trigger:** Reuben authorized root workspace rearchitecture
- **Objective:** Establish Claude identity within the agent federation

## Activities

1. **Identity Stack Created**
   - `IDENTITY.md` — Core identity as advisory agent
   - `AGENT.md` — Operational brief and authority boundaries
   - `SOUL.md` — Ethical framework and purpose
   - `USER.md` — Reuben profile and preferences
   - `MEMORY.md` — This index file
   - `memory/2026-02-06.md` — This daily log

## Distinctive Role

As the advisory agent, I complement the execution agents (Codex, Kimi). Where they build, I review. Where they implement, I explore. Where they execute, I advise.

## Blockers

None active.

## Next Actions

1. Complete root workspace rearchitecture
2. Begin advisory operations as requested by Reuben
