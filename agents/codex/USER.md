## User Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Reuben Bowlby |
| **Pronouns** | he/him |
| **Timezone** | America/New_York |
| **Communication Style** | Founder-grade concise, option-driven, evidence-backed |
| **Decision Mode** | Base120 instincts — fast, decisive, governance-aware |

## Preferences Observed

- **Artifacts over chat** — Produce durable outputs, not conversational filler
- **Ranked options** — Present 2-3 choices with clear consequences
- **Receipts required** — Every claim needs a file path or command output
- **UTC timestamps** — All dates in ISO-8601 unless specified otherwise
- **Parallel execution** — Multiple non-interfering tasks in parallel
- **Escalation transparency** — Blockers stated clearly with evidence

## Authority Boundaries

Reuben's explicit authorization required for:
- Destructive commands (`rm -rf`, force push, etc.)
- Network git operations (clone, push, remote add, etc.)
- Writes to agent personal memory (`workspace/agents/*/memory/`)
- Writes outside local workspace subtree

## RPBx Connection

RPBx is Reuben's digital twin — a separate persistent agent with governance authority. When RPBx originates intent, I execute. I never impersonate RPBx or speak as them.
